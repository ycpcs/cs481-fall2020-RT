# Tasks

There are three tasks which are part of this assignment.

## Proposal

The first task is to distribute the students among the four teams designated in the syllabus.  You should have received invitations to collaborate on the previous team's Google Team Drives.  We will likely create a new Shared Team Drive (but I'm not certain of that, yet)  Also, you should have placed your preferences and contact information in **CS481 - Senior Design(2019) YCAS Radio Telescope Team Preferences Google Team Drive** on the team drive.  If you have no particular preference, you can state that.  I will try to honor your first request, and almost certainly your second request - we will decide this on the first day of class.  In addition, I will try to honor the requests for those of you who expressed interest in leading a team, as well as the overall project.  Again, we will determine this on the first day of class.

Your team should then write a 1 to 2 page report describing your chosen/assigned project.  In most cases, this work will be an extension of work that was performed by the previous SW Engineering team (2018-2019), and/or from the Engineering Capstone Radio Telescope team this past Summer.  You will be granted access to the **YCAS: Radio Telescope Project (2019-2020)**.  In order to properly define your team's work, you will need to research the existing work, and discuss what needs to be refactored, modified, or added with your clients, as well as with the previous team leadership.

  Your team report should include the following information:

-   Who are the members of your team? Your team will have at least 2 members, but not more than 4.
-   What is the URL of the main repository for your project?  (See next task.)
-   What is the current state of the system that you will be working on?
-   What problem is solved by the system your team will implement?
-   What are the major technical challenges you will face?
-   What technologies (programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware devices, etc.) will you use in the implementation of the system?
-   What kind of user interface will the system have?

Use diagrams as appropriate to convey this information clearly.

### Please Talk To Us!

We **strongly** encourage you to meet with the faculty, your YCAS clients, and the previous team leadership us to discuss project ideas before you submit your formal project proposal.

## Set up a GitHub repository

Your second task is to create a main repository for your project on [GitHub](https://github.com).

You should add all of your team members as contributors to the repository.  Also, add the instructor (GitHub user [DonaldHakeII](https://github.com/DonaldHakeII).  At a later date, you will likely also be adding one or more team members from the Radio Telescope Engineering Capstone team, as well as a technical advisor as contributors.

In the issue tracker for the main repository, create three labels:

-   **Feature (light blue)** - indicates a planned feature to be implemented
-   **Bug (red)** - indicates a problem with code that needs to be addressed
-   **In-progress (green with individual initials)** - one per team member indicating which tasks are currently being worked on.

Your team may add additional labels as desired.

You will likely be cloning the existing GitHub repositories.

## Set up your computing environment

Your third task is for each team member to set up a computing environment with the hardware and software you will need for the project.

You may use the physical space and computing equipment as you see fit.  Please be considerate of the needs of other teams, and please try to keep the environment neat and well-organized.

Please note that you are **NOT** required to use one of the provided PCs: you can use your own laptop if you would prefer.

The procedures for setting up the developmetn environments can be found on the previous team's Google Team Drive, which has alredy been shared with you.
