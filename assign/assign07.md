# Your Task

Your task is to complete a final report documenting your project, and to give a presentation on the project. Our expectations for the report are described in the [Final Report Details](finalreport.html) document.

We **strongly encourage** you to make an appointment and visit the [Writing Center in the Center for Teaching and Learning](http://www.ycp.edu/offices-and-services/center-for-teaching-and-learning/writing-center/) to get help from a writing tutor. Bring your document with you!

### Presentation Guidelines

**NOTE: The following is subject to change, as the four teams in this section are working on separate components of the same system.  It may be necessary to combine certain team presentations in order to provide a cohesive overall system-level presentation.  We will discuss this in more detail as the system development evolves throughout the course of the semester.**

Your team will give a presentation of about 20 minutes, leaving 5 minutes for a question and answer session.

You should use some presentation software such as Keynote, PowerPoint, or a Google presentation. Your slides should contain brief bulleted points. They should not be a "wall of text". Use animations sparingly. DO NOT USE SOUND EFFECTS!!!

**Please rehearse your presentation!** We can't allow any presentation to go over its allotted time. You may wish to have a few notecards for reference. However, you should not read directly from your notecards or from your slides. This makes for a very boring and painful presentation.

Keep in mind that the audience for your presentation consists of students and faculty in CS and Engineering, as well as your clients (YCAS members), alumni and technical advisors. Don't assume that the audience knows anything about your specific project. However, you can assume that the audience is reasonably knowledgeable about computers, software, etc.

Don't get too bogged down in details. As with any form of technical communication, you want to emphasize the most important and interesting information. Provide supporting details if they are necessary, but otherwise try to keep the presentation at a fairly high level.

Here is a suggested structure for your presentation:

1.  Background (\~2 minutes): What problem were you trying to solve? Discuss the system requirements.

2.  Analysis and design (\~4 minutes): Discuss your design model. In this part of the presentation, you must show a UML class diagram illustrating the most important classes and methods in your system, and how they relate/interact with each other. You can use multiple UML diagrams if a single diagram would have too many classes.

    This is also a good opportunity to discuss how the design of the system changed as you worked on the implementation.

3.  Implementation (\~4 minutes): What were the most interesting things you learned when you implemented the system? If you used any interesting programming techniques, this is a good opportunity to discuss them. **Do not show code during your presentation.**

4.  Demonstration (\~8 minutes): Show your system working. Demonstrate the most important/interesting features. You should have a scripted demonstration that you practiced multiple times prior to the presentation. You do NOT need to show every feature of your software. If you do, your demo will be too long and bore your audience.

5.  Conclusions (\~2 minutes): Sum up what you learned, particularly for underclassmen. If there are aspects of the project you would do differently if you started again from scratch, mention them. You can also talk about how you might want to extend the system in the future.

**All of the members of your team must participate in the presentation.**

Make sure that your presentation is ready to go immediately when it is your team's turn, since you will have only a minute or two to set up. (That's plenty of time to connect a laptop to the projector cable.)
